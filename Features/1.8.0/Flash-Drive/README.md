# Flash Drive
This page will talk about the Flash Drive.

## Introduction
The Flash Drive object originally appeared in 1.7.0/1.7.1 with the Cube object.\
It was discovered whem a Discord member of the PC Simulator Discord shared a save containing Cubes and Flash Drives.

## Utility

### 1.7.0/1.7.1
In this update, the Flash Drive did literally nothing, as it probably wasn't implemented yet.

### 1.8.0/1.8.1 (iOS and iPadOS)
In this update, the Flash Drive is used as a storage media, where you can install PCOS in it using a [Save Editor](../../../Save-Editor/Save-Editors/). Although it was originally made to store files and the PCOS installer.\
There's two varients of the Flash Drive:
- The normal Flash Drive
- The PCOS Flash Drive

Thoses are the same object, except that the PCOS Flash Drive already contains file, and is renamed.
