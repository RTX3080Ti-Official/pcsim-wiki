<p>This page will talk about the Flash Drive.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Flash Drive object originally appeared in 1.7.0/1.7.1 with the Cube object.<br />
It was discovered whem a Discord member of the PC Simulator Discord shared a save containing Cubes and Flash Drives.</p>

<h2 id="utility">Utility</h2>

<h3 id="170171">1.7.0/1.7.1</h3>
<p>In this update, the Flash Drive did literally nothing, as it probably wasn’t implemented yet.</p>

<h3 id="180181-ios-and-ipados">1.8.0/1.8.1 (iOS and iPadOS)</h3>
<p>In this update, the Flash Drive is used as a storage media, where you can install PCOS in it using a <a href="../../../Save-Editor/Save-Editors/">Save Editor</a>. Although it was originally made to store files and the PCOS installer.<br />
There’s two varients of the Flash Drive:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The normal Flash Drive</li>
  <li>The PCOS Flash Drive</li>
</ul>

<p>Thoses are the same object, except that the PCOS Flash Drive already contains file, and is renamed.</p>
