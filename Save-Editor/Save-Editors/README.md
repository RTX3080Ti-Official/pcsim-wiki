## Which one to choose?
Personnally, I prefer the first one, for 2 reasons.

1. It has a lot of features
2. It's a lot less laggy than the second one.

But if you want a simpler one, go with the second.

<sup>**I wasn't paid/promoted/anything like that by those save editors to be mentionned in this wiki, those are the only ones I know and are popular, the rating were based on personal choices and some more personal things.**</sup>
